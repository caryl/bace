Description:
    Stubs out a new factory. Pass the factory name name, under_scored,
    and an optional list of attribute pairs as arguments.

    Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes. Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to
    specify them by hand as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'.

    This generates a file in test/factories.

Examples:
    `./script/generate factory account`

        creates an Account factory: test/factories/account_factory.rb

    `./script/generate factory post title:string body:text published:boolean`

        creates a Post factory with a string title, text body, and published flag.
